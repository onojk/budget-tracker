⚡ Inline Editing (New!)

The Transactions page now supports true real-time cell editing, powered by:

A frontend JS handler that listens to clicks on .editable table cells

A dynamic <input> that appears when you click

A PUT /api/transactions/<id> JSON update

Automatic re-render of the updated value

Editable fields:

Date

Merchant

Description

Amount (validated as float)

Category

Notes

Example JSON update:
PUT /api/transactions/42
{
  "amount": 19.99,
  "category": "Groceries",
  "notes": "Fixed amount"
}


The server responds:

{
  "status": "ok",
  "transaction": {
    "id": 42,
    "date": "2025-01-08",
    "merchant": "FOOD4LESS",
    "amount": 19.99,
    "category": "Groceries",
    "notes": ""
  }
}
